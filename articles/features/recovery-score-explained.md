MyBodyWatch™ simplifies fitness tracking with a 0-10 MyBodyWatch Score system. This single number tells you everything you need to know about your body's current fitness status.

## How Your Score is Calculated

Your score combines three critical fitness metrics:

### 1. Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats, indicating your autonomic nervous system's balance. Higher HRV typically suggests better recovery and adaptation capacity.

### 2. Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
Unlike Apple's standard RHR calculation that provides a daily average, MyBodyWatch™ factors in subtle RHR changes throughout the day. This allows you to see how your body responds to workouts in real-time.

### 3. Sleep Quality
Good sleep is essential for optimal performance. We analyze your sleep patterns to determine how effectively your body is preparing for the day ahead.

## Understanding the Relationship

Unlike simple metrics where "more is always better," your score intelligently interprets each factor's unique characteristics:

- **Higher HRV** (more variability) = Better autonomic function and recovery capacity
- **Lower RHR** (less effort required) = Better cardiovascular fitness and recovery state  
- **Better sleep** (quality and duration) = Better recovery and preparation

Your score automatically handles these different scales and directions, so you don't need to remember whether higher or lower is better for each metric.

## Your Personal Baseline

What makes MyBodyWatch™ truly unique is our 90-day baseline approach. Instead of comparing you to generic population averages, we establish YOUR normal ranges for each metric. Your score reflects deviations from your personal baseline, making it far more relevant to your individual physiology.

## Interpreting Your Score

- **8-10**: Excellent territory. Your body may be primed for high-intensity training or demanding activities.
- **6-7**: Good territory. Consider moderate intensity activities that align with how you feel.
- **3-5**: Mixed territory. May be best for light activity or gentle movement.
- **0-2**: Lower territory. Consider focusing on rest or very light activity.

Remember, consistently pushing through lower scores may not be optimal for your long-term fitness goals. Consider using your score alongside how you feel to guide your training and rest decisions.
