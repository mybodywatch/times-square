# Understanding Your Recovery Score

MyBodyWatch™ simplifies health tracking with our proprietary 0-10 recovery score system. This single number tells you everything you need to know about your body's current recovery state.

## How Your Score is Calculated

Your recovery score combines three critical health metrics:

### 1. Heart Rate Variability (HRV)
HRV measures the variation in time between heartbeats, indicating your autonomic nervous system's balance. Higher HRV typically suggests better recovery and adaptation capacity.

### 2. Resting Heart Rate (RHR)
Unlike Apple's standard RHR calculation that provides a daily average, MyBodyWatch™ uses a proprietary algorithm that detects subtle RHR changes throughout the day. This allows you to see how your body responds to workouts in real-time.

### 3. Sleep Quality
Good sleep is essential for recovery. We analyze your sleep patterns to determine how effectively your body is recovering overnight.

## Your Personal Baseline

What makes MyBodyWatch™ truly unique is our 90-day baseline approach. Instead of comparing you to generic population averages, we establish YOUR normal ranges for each metric. Your score reflects deviations from your personal baseline, making it far more relevant to your individual physiology.

## Interpreting Your Score

- **8-10**: Fully recovered. Your body is primed for high-intensity training or stress.
- **6-7**: Moderately recovered. Good for moderate intensity activities.
- **3-5**: Partial recovery. Best for light activity or active recovery.
- **0-2**: Minimal recovery. Consider extra rest or very light activity.

Remember, consistently pushing through low scores can lead to overtraining and increased injury risk. Trust your score to optimize your training and recovery cycles.
