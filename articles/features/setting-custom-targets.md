While MyBodyWatch™ automatically establishes your personal baseline, you can further personalize your experience by setting custom targets for specific metrics.

## Why Set Custom Targets?

Custom targets allow you to:

- Focus on specific areas of your health
- Account for known personal factors
- Address specific training or recovery goals
- Compensate for unusual life circumstances

## Setting Custom Targets

To set custom targets:

1. Open your MyBodyWatch™ app
2. Navigate to Settings > BodyWatch Index Metrics
3. Select the metric you want to customize (HRV, RHR, Sleep)
4. Tap "Set Custom Target"
5. Adjust the slider to your desired target value
6. Save your changes

Your custom targets will override the automatic baseline calculations when determining your BodyWatch Index.

## Target Recommendations

While you have complete flexibility, here are some evidence-based recommendations:

### For Athletic Performance
- **HRV**: Set targets 5-10% above your normal baseline during maintenance phases
- **RHR**: Target 2-3 BPM below your normal baseline
- **Sleep**: Target 7.5-9 hours depending on training volume

### For Stress Management
- **HRV**: Set conservative targets (90-95% of baseline)
- **RHR**: Target within 1 BPM of baseline
- **Sleep**: Target 8-9 hours

## Resetting to Automatic Baseline

You can return to automatic baseline calculations at any time:

1. Go to Settings > BodyWatch Index Metrics
2. Select the customized metric
3. Tap "Reset to Automatic"

This flexibility ensures MyBodyWatch™ adapts to your changing needs throughout your health and fitness journey.
