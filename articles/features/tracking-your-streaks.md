Consistency is the foundation of lasting health improvements. MyBodyWatch™ helps you maintain your momentum with our streak tracking feature.

## How Streaks Work

MyBodyWatch™ automatically tracks your login streaks:

- A streak begins with your first login
- Each day you open the app adds to your streak count
- Missing a day resets your streak to zero
- Streaks are displayed on your dashboard

This simple feature provides powerful motivation to check in daily and stay connected with your recovery metrics.

## The Science of Habit Formation

Research shows that tracking streaks enhances habit formation through several psychological mechanisms:

1. **Visual Progress**: Seeing your streak count grow provides tangible evidence of your commitment
2. **Loss Aversion**: The desire not to break a streak becomes a powerful motivator
3. **Identity Reinforcement**: Maintaining streaks strengthens your self-image as someone who prioritizes health

## Streak Milestones

MyBodyWatch™ celebrates your consistency with milestone recognition:

- 7 Days: Weekly Warrior

## Tips for Maintaining Your Streak

- **Set a consistent check-in time**: Morning works best for most users
- **Enable notifications**: Get reminders if you haven't checked your app by your usual time
- **Create a trigger**: Pair app checking with another daily habit like brushing teeth
- **Travel strategy**: Check in during transit when crossing time zones to avoid missing days

Remember, the ultimate goal isn't just a long streak but the consistent awareness of your recovery status that the streak represents.
