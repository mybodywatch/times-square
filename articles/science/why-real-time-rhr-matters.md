# Why Real-Time RHR Matters

Resting Heart Rate (RHR) is a critical biomarker for health and recovery status, but not all RHR measurements are created equal. MyBodyWatch™ takes a unique approach to RHR tracking that provides more actionable insights than standard methods.

## The Problem with Standard RHR Calculations

Most fitness trackers, including Apple's standard approach, calculate RHR as a daily average using readings taken during periods of relative inactivity. This method has significant limitations:

1. **Delayed Feedback**: A daily average only updates once per day, missing rapid changes in your body's status
2. **Diluted Signal**: Averaging readings across 24 hours blends multiple physiological states, muddying the insights
3. **Missing Context**: Traditional RHR calculations don't account for recent exercise, sleep quality, or other contextual factors

## MyBodyWatch's™ Real-Time RHR Approach

Our proprietary algorithm takes a fundamentally different approach:

### Continuous Monitoring

Rather than waiting for a daily average, we analyze heart rate data continuously throughout the day, looking for the true physiological resting state.

### Exercise Response Detection

After a workout, your RHR will naturally be elevated. Our algorithm detects these post-exercise elevations and factors them into your recovery score, giving you immediate feedback on how your body is responding.

### Contextual Analysis

We examine your heart rate patterns in context with your activity levels, time of day, and recent training history to identify meaningful deviations from your baseline.

## Why This Matters for Performance

Research shows that acute RHR changes can predict:

- **Training Readiness**: Elevated morning RHR often precedes poor performance
- **Recovery Status**: Prolonged post-exercise RHR elevation indicates incomplete recovery
- **Adaptation Phase**: Decreasing RHR trend during a training block suggests positive adaptation
- **Illness Risk**: Sudden RHR increases of 5+ BPM can precede illness by 24-48 hours

## The Science of Cardiac Autonomic Recovery

Your heart rate is regulated by your autonomic nervous system. During recovery from exercise or stress:

1. Parasympathetic reactivation gradually slows your heart rate
2. Complete recovery is reflected in RHR returning to baseline
3. Inadequate recovery keeps RHR elevated above baseline

MyBodyWatch™ captures these subtle but crucial changes that standard daily averages miss, giving you a more accurate picture of your body's true recovery status.
