# Research Citations & Scientific Methodology

MyBodyWatch is built on established scientific research and industry-standard data collection methods. This section provides citations to the primary research sources that inform our scoring methodology and interpretation guidelines.

**Important Notice**: This content is provided for educational purposes only and is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease or medical condition. MyBodyWatch is designed for general wellness and fitness tracking, not medical diagnosis or treatment. Always consult with qualified healthcare professionals regarding your health and before making any medical decisions.

## Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Research

### Primary Standards and Guidelines

**Heart Rate Variability: Standards of Measurement, Physiological Interpretation, and Clinical Use**  
*Task Force of the European Society of Cardiology and the North American Society of Pacing and Electrophysiology*  
European Heart Journal, 1996  
[View on PubMed](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8737210/)

This foundational document established the international standards for HRV measurement, analysis techniques, and clinical interpretation that are widely used in research and clinical practice today.

**An Overview of Heart Rate Variability Metrics and Norms**  
*Fred Shaffer, J.P. Ginsberg*  
Frontiers in Public Health, 2017  
[View Full Article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpubh.2017.00258/full)

A comprehensive review of HRV time-domain, frequency-domain, and non-linear metrics with established normative values for healthy populations.

### HRV and Recovery Research

**Cardiac Autonomic Responses during Exercise and Post-exercise Recovery Using Heart Rate Variability**  
*Scott Michael, Kenneth S. Graham, Glen M. Davis*  
Frontiers in Physiology, 2017  
[View Full Article](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00301/full)

Research demonstrating how HRV responds to exercise stress and recovery, supporting the use of HRV as a recovery indicator.

## Sleep Quality Research

### Sleep Science and Quality Measurement

**Sleep Foundation: Understanding Sleep Stages**  
*Sleep Foundation Research Team*  
Sleep Foundation, 2024  
[View Resource](https://www.sleepfoundation.org/how-sleep-works/stages-of-sleep)

Comprehensive overview of sleep stages, sleep quality factors, and the relationship between sleep duration and restorative sleep quality.

### Sleep and Recovery Research

Sleep quality significantly impacts recovery capacity and autonomic nervous system function. Research consistently shows that poor sleep quality correlates with reduced HRV and impaired recovery markers.

## Data Collection Methodology

### Apple HealthKit Integration

**Apple Health and Fitness Technologies**  
*Apple Developer Documentation*  
Apple Inc., 2024  
[View Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/health-fitness/)

Official documentation for Apple's health data collection standards, privacy frameworks, and measurement methodologies used in HealthKit-enabled applications.

### Data Privacy and Security

MyBodyWatch follows Apple's strict health data privacy guidelines. All health data remains on your device and is never transmitted to external servers without your explicit consent.

## Scoring Methodology

### Personalized Baseline Approach

MyBodyWatch uses a 90-day rolling baseline approach rather than population averages. This methodology is based on research showing significant individual variation in physiological markers, making personalized baselines more accurate for individual assessment.

### Multi-metric Integration

Our scoring algorithm combines multiple validated health markers:

- **HRV (Time-domain analysis)**: Using established RMSSD calculations per Task Force guidelines
- **Resting Heart Rate**: Real-time analysis of heart rate patterns throughout the day
- **Sleep Quality**: Duration and efficiency metrics based on sleep research standards

## Limitations and Considerations

### Not a Medical Device

MyBodyWatch is designed for wellness and fitness tracking purposes only. It is not intended to diagnose, treat, or prevent any medical condition.

### Individual Variation

All physiological metrics show significant individual variation. What constitutes "normal" varies greatly between individuals, which is why MyBodyWatch emphasizes personal baselines over population norms.

### Continuous Research

The field of digital health and wellness tracking continues to evolve. We regularly review new research to improve our methodologies while maintaining scientific rigor.

## Additional Resources

For users interested in deeper scientific understanding, we recommend exploring the peer-reviewed research cited above. These sources provide comprehensive technical details about the methodologies underlying modern HRV analysis and sleep quality assessment.
