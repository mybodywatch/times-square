Recovery isn't just about rest—it's about strategic practices that help your body rebuild and prepare for the next challenge. Use these evidence-based techniques to improve your MyBodyWatch™ recovery score.

## 1. Prioritize Sleep Quality

Sleep is your body's prime recovery time. Aim for these improvements:

- **Consistent Schedule**: Go to bed and wake up at the same time daily
- **Sleep Environment**: Keep your bedroom cool (65-68°F/18-20°C), dark, and quiet
- **Wind Down Routine**: Implement a 30-minute pre-sleep ritual without screens
- **Limit Stimulants**: Avoid caffeine after noon and alcohol close to bedtime

Your MyBodyWatch™ score is heavily influenced by sleep quality—making this your highest-leverage recovery tool.

## 2. Strategic Nutrition Timing

Nutrient timing can significantly impact recovery:

- **Post-Workout Window**: Consume protein and carbohydrates within 30-45 minutes after intense exercise
- **Evening Protein**: A small protein serving before bed supports overnight muscle repair
- **Hydration**: Drink half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces of water daily

## 3. Active Recovery Techniques

When your score is in the 3-5 range, consider these active recovery approaches:

- **Zone 2 Training**: Light cardio keeping heart rate at 60-70% of max
- **Mobility Work**: Dynamic stretching and joint mobilization
- **Low-Impact Activities**: Swimming, cycling, or walking

## 4. Stress Management

Mental stress directly impacts physical recovery through elevated cortisol:

- **Mindfulness Practice**: Even 5-10 minutes of meditation can reduce stress hormones
- **Breathing Exercises**: Try 4-7-8 breathing (inhale for 4, hold for 7, exhale for 8)
- **Nature Exposure**: Spending time outdoors has been shown to lower stress markers

## 5. Cold/Heat Contrast Therapy

Temperature contrasts can accelerate recovery:

- **Cold Exposure**: 5-10 minutes of cold shower or ice bath reduces inflammation
- **Heat Therapy**: Sauna sessions of 15-20 minutes improve circulation and protein synthesis
- **Contrast Protocol**: Alternate between 3 minutes hot, 1 minute cold, repeated 3-4 times
