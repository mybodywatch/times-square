Thank you for downloading MyBodyWatch™! We're excited to help you better understand your body's fitness status through our simple, intuitive BodyWatch Score system.

## What Makes MyBodyWatch™ Different

MyBodyWatch simplifies fitness tracking by transforming complex metrics into a single, easy-to-understand BodyWatch Score from 0-10. Instead of trying to interpret multiple data points yourself, we combine key factors to do the work for you.

## Understanding Your BodyWatch Score

Your BodyWatch Score is calculated based on three key metrics:

1. **Sleep Quality** - How well your body recovered during rest
2. **Resting Heart Rate (RHR)** - The baseline activity of your cardiovascular system
3. **Heart Rate Variability (HRV)** - A powerful indicator of your autonomic nervous system balance

What makes our approach unique is that we establish **your personal baseline** rather than comparing you to population averages. Your body is unique, and so are your metrics!

## Getting Started

Here's how to get the most out of MyBodyWatch™:

1. Wear your Apple Watch consistently, especially during sleep
2. Check your BodyWatch Score each morning after waking up
3. Pay attention to how your index correlates with how you feel physically and mentally
4. Use the insights to make better decisions about your daily activities and rest
