One of the most powerful features of MyBodyWatch™ is our personalized 90-day baseline. Unlike other health trackers that compare you to generic population averages, we build a baseline that's uniquely yours.

## Why a Personal Baseline Matters

Each person's "normal" is different. Factors like:

- Age
- Genetics
- Fitness level
- Training history
- Work schedule
- Sleep patterns

All influence what's "normal" for YOUR body. A heart rate variability (HRV) reading of 45ms might be excellent for one person but concerning for another.

## How Your Baseline is Established

During your first 90 days with MyBodyWatch™:

1. The app collects data on your HRV, resting heart rate, and sleep patterns
2. Our algorithm identifies your typical ranges for each metric
3. We establish what's normal for YOU specifically
4. Your MyBodyWatch Score becomes increasingly personalized over time

Even during this initial period, you'll receive scores, but they'll become more accurate as your baseline develops.

## Reading Your Score Against Your Baseline

Your daily score indicates how your current metrics compare to your personal baseline:

- **8-10**: Well above your baseline (excellent territory)
- **6-7**: Slightly above your baseline (good territory)
- **3-5**: Around your baseline (moderate territory)
- **0-2**: Below your baseline (lower territory)

This personalized approach makes MyBodyWatch™ uniquely valuable for:

- Athletes at any level
- Fitness enthusiasts
- Those managing stress or health conditions
- Anyone wanting to optimize their fitness insights

## Refining Your Baseline Over Time

Your baseline isn't static—it adapts as you do:

- The app continually updates your baseline as your fitness improves
- Seasonal variations are factored into baseline calculations
- Major life changes (new job, moving, etc.) will be incorporated

This ensures your score always provides relevant insights as your body and life evolve.

By understanding your personal baseline, you can make better decisions about when to push hard and when to prioritize rest, all based on YOUR unique physiology.
